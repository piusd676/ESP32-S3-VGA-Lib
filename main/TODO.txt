[]VGADisplayManager: Circle, Oval, Line, Loading picture, layer management, Text display, playing video, incl. metadata, Objects for draw Methods to simplify implementation of scroll logic
-> seperate array for easily moving objects like circles
[Test programs]:Colors, functions, self verification
Fetch img dimensions from metadata once implemented, implement img chooser(using string)
Change bits once we use 16 bits
For scrolling logic: do double buffering properly from within VGADisplayManager (including ISR) to circumvent screen tearing and do wait for vsync
Optimize display() logic
Using scroller on any layer besides framebuffer is buggy
baking background etc onto scroller?
